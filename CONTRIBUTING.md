## Are you new to Open Source?

If you’re a **new** open source contributor, the process can be intimidating.  
_What if you don’t know how to code?_ What if something goes wrong? **Don't worry!**

**You don’t have to contribute code!** A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you
need to _contribute code_. In fact, it’s often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or
overlooked. You’ll do the project a _huge favor_ by offering to pitch in with these types of
**contributions**!

**Even if you like to write code**, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a
project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on
other parts of the project.
